This program simulates alien species colonizing planets in a star system. Aliens and planets begin in predefined locations specified by a map text file. As the simulation progresses, they will increase in population until they reach the capacity for their planet and begin sending spaceships to colonize new planets. Aliens encountering other species will fight each other for control. The simulation stores its state in three 2-dimensional vectors, for placement of the planets, spaceships, and explosions for flair. The user can choose to start, stop, and reset the simulation in the GUI displaying the simulation, as well as change both the background and initial placement map.
